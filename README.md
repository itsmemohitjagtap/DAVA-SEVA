# DAVA SEVA ‚Äì Automated Ayush Medicine Dispensing System

**DAVA SEVA** (Drug Automated Vending Aparatus ‚Äì Swayamchalit E-Aushadhi Vikri Aalay) is an innovative, Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project that aims to revolutionize healthcare accessibility by providing an **automated dispensing solution for Ayurvedic medicines**. It functions like an ATM machine, simplifying medicine distribution using modern embedded systems, user-friendly mobile UI, and secure digital verification.

## ü©∫ Problem Statement

In rural and remote regions, access to authentic **Ayush (Ayurvedic)** medicines is limited. DAVA SEVA provides a **self-operable dispensing ATM** that ensures:

* Authenticity
* Convenience
* Accuracy
* Affordability
* Availability in regional languages (20+)

## üöÄ Features

* üîí **Secure QR-Based Prescription**: Patients receive a unique QR code after prescription by a certified Ayush doctor.
* üì± **Mobile App Integration**: Patient receives and stores prescription QR securely.
* üßæ **Instant Verification**: QR code is scanned at the ATM for instant verification.
* üíä **Automated Dispensing**: Dispensing mechanism delivers the exact medicines.
* üí≥ **UPI-Based Payment**: Simple, cashless transaction interface.
* üåê **24/7 Availability**: Machines can operate around the clock.

## üß† System Architecture

### 1. **Software Module**

* **Prescription Upload**: Doctor saves prescription on web portal ‚Üí stored in patient profile.
* **QR Generation**: System generates a unique QR and sends it to the patient.
* **Patient App**: Securely stores and manages the QR for use at DAVA SEVA ATM.

### 2. **Hardware Module**

* **QR Scanner & Display Unit**: Raspberry Pi-based system scans the QR and displays prescription.
* **Availability Check**: System checks inventory and calculates cost.
* **Payment Gateway**: UPI QR code or ID options for seamless payment.
* **Medicine Dispensing Mechanism**:

  * **X & Y Axis Movement** using Lead Screw Linear Actuators.
  * Tray-based medicine outlet guided by microprocessor-controlled motors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Demo)

> *For demonstration only; actual deployment involves hardware integration.*

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DAVA-SEVA.git
   cd DAVA-SEVA
   ```

2. Run UI locally:

   * Android Studio for Mobile App
   * Python scripts for QR & hardware logic (if available)

3. Upload prescriptions through the doctor‚Äôs portal (simulated).

4. Use test QR to simulate ATM flow.
